## Fixed

- Fixed that the player may not be rendered in the proper model.
- Fixed that "Operations Panel" in "Texture Details" page is shown even if current user is not privileged.
- Fixed that banning the texture uploader will in fact ban the reporter.
- Fixed that an error will occur when handling a report whose texture has been deleted.
